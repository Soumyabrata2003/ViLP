This is the official implementation of our **ViLP**, which leverages cross-modal bridge to enhance video recognition by exploring tri-directional knowledge.
</div>

## Overview
üö¥**BIKE** explores bidirectional cross-modal knowledge from the pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) to introduce auxiliary attributes and category-dependent temporal saliency for improved video recognition.

## Data Preparation



### Video Loader

**(Recommend)** To train all of our models, we extract videos into frames for fast reading. Please refer to [MVFNet](https://github.com/whwu95/MVFNet/blob/main/data_process/DATASETS.md) repo for the detailed guide of dataset processing.  
The annotation file is a text file with multiple lines, and each line indicates the directory to frames of a video, total frames of the video and the label of a video, which are split with a whitespace. 
<details open><summary>Example of annotation</summary>

```sh
abseiling/-7kbO0v4hag_000107_000117 300 0
abseiling/-bwYZwnwb8E_000013_000023 300 0
```
</details>

(Optional) We can also decode the videos in an online fashion using [decord](https://github.com/dmlc/decord). This manner should work but are not tested. All of the models offered have been trained using offline frames. 
<details><summary>Example of annotation</summary>

```sh
  abseiling/-7kbO0v4hag_000107_000117.mp4 0
  abseiling/-bwYZwnwb8E_000013_000023.mp4 0
```
</details>


### Annotation
Annotation information consists of two parts: video label, and category description.

- Video Label: As mentioned above, this part is same as the traditional video recognition. Please refer to [lists/k400/kinetics_rgb_train_se320.txt](lists/k400/kinetics_rgb_train_se320.txt) for the format.
- Category Description: We also need a textual description for each video category.  Please refer to [lists/k400/kinetics_400_labels.csv](lists/k400/kinetics_400_labels.csv) for the format.
